This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman’s half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother’s reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis’ Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father’s death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of “Aquaman” artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2”), production designer Bill Brzeski (“Jumanji: The Next Level”), editor Kirk Morri (“Furious 7”), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (“Malignant”).

              "description": "FOX Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt marvels at the atmosphere in Boulder as Coach Prime won his home debut over Nebraska. Klatt breaks down what impressed him about their win while also considering how incredible it is that a Colorado team that was 1-11 last season is captivating the country right now. Next, he shifts to Texas’ huge win over Alabama and why it shows that the Longhorns are legitimate national championship contenders this year. He also reveals how far the win in Tuscaloosa launched Texas up his Top 10 rankings. Klatt states whether that game was a sign that Alabama under Saban is set for a fall from the sport’s elite programs.  He then discusses how scary USC is this year and why he believes this team is different than last year’s group.  He also goes in on how Texas A&M continues to fall short in the Jimbo Fisher era after their loss in Miami.  Finally, Klatt reacts to the news of Michigan State HC Mel Tucker being suspended without pay due to an investigation into sexual harassment allegations.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Joel Klatt Show content: \nhttps://rb.gy/7sbi9\n\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►The Joel Klatt Show YouTube Channel: https://bit.ly/joelklattshow_yt\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n \nSee more from The Joel Klatt Show: https://www.foxsports.com/shows/the-joel-klatt-show\n\nLike The Joel Klatt Show on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JoelKlattShow/\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JoelKlattShow\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joelklattshow/\n\nColorado & Coach Prime take down Nebraska, Texas rolls the Tide & rises in Klatt’s Top 10 Rankings\nhttps://youtu.be/FkVM19h9Kus",

                  "description": "FOX Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt marvels at the atmosphere in Boulder as Coach Prime won his home debut over Nebraska. Klatt breaks down what impressed him about their win while also considering how incredible it is that a Colorado team that was 1-11 last season is captivating the country right now. Next, he shifts to Texas’ huge win over Alabama and why it shows that the Longhorns are legitimate national championship contenders this year. He also reveals how far the win in Tuscaloosa launched Texas up his Top 10 rankings. Klatt states whether that game was a sign that Alabama under Saban is set for a fall from the sport’s elite programs.  He then discusses how scary USC is this year and why he believes this team is different than last year’s group.  He also goes in on how Texas A&M continues to fall short in the Jimbo Fisher era after their loss in Miami.  Finally, Klatt reacts to the news of Michigan State HC Mel Tucker being suspended without pay due to an investigation into sexual harassment allegations.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Joel Klatt Show content: \nhttps://rb.gy/7sbi9\n\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►The Joel Klatt Show YouTube Channel: https://bit.ly/joelklattshow_yt\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n \nSee more from The Joel Klatt Show: https://www.foxsports.com/shows/the-joel-klatt-show\n\nLike The Joel Klatt Show on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JoelKlattShow/\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JoelKlattShow\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joelklattshow/\n\nColorado & Coach Prime take down Nebraska, Texas rolls the Tide & rises in Klatt’s Top 10 Rankings\nhttps://youtu.be/FkVM19h9Kus"
